## Objective:
The Kid’s Cottage blog allows parent to be actively involved in the daily lives of their children even though they can’t be physically present. The blog’s goal is to be a continuation of the Cottage community encouraging parents to get involved and begin conversations with other parents and staff.

## Use:
 - Problem <br>
 Communication with parents is either impersonal or time consuming. New students typically come from referrals so keeping parents happy is essential to the bottom line.
 - Ethics: <br>
Parents trust us to watch their kids but communication doesn’t occur naturally so trust is lost.
 - Perspectives:<br>
Parents: No one talks to us. My kid’s are really happy and I love it there but I never know what’s going on. <br>
Staff: I want to communicate with parents but it takes my eyes off the other kids in the room.<br>
Potential Parents: No web presence, important to millennial parents.
 - Solution: <br>
Site Face-Lift give static site a new look and feel
Build on CMS to allow Kid’s Cottage to have more control
Implement google analytics to track user data
Implement a Blog Site as a simple solution to keep parents involved.
As business grows integrate login and portal features - no CMS as project is ongoing
 - Impact: <br>
 Parents feel more engaged with the staff, leading to an increase in referrals and retention.
