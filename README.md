# Kid's Cottage

## Objective:
The Kid’s Cottage blog allows parent to be actively involved in the daily lives of their children even though they can’t be physically present. The blog’s goal is to be a continuation of the Cottage community encouraging parents to get involved and begin conversations with other parents and staff.


## Use:
 - Problem
 Communication with parents is either impersonal or time consuming. New students typically come from referrals so keeping parents happy is essential to the bottom line.
 - Ethics
Parents trust us to watch their kids but communication doesn’t occur naturally so trust is lost.
 - Perspectives
Parents: No one talks to us. My kid’s are really happy and I love it there but I never know what’s going on.
Staff: I want to communicate with parents but it takes my eyes off the other kids in the room.
Potential Parents: No web presence, important to millennial parents
